    "The core design principle is the use of a time-based blending mechanism when transitioning from the AVOIDING state back to NAVIGATING. This technique is a critical engineering choice to prevent control signal instability (overshooting or oscillation) upon re-entry to the complex proportional goal-seeking behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition is governed by a fixed-duration cooldown phase (AVOIDANCE_DURATION = $\\mathbf{4.0\\text{ s}}$). During this time, the output motor commands are a linear interpolation between the stable, simple command (Drive Straight) and the complex navigation command (Move to Point).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Choices and Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fixed Cooldown Duration ($\\mathbf{4.0\\text{ s}}$): This fixed time, rather than a proportional distance or angular correction, was chosen for its robustness in the constrained Thymio environment. It guarantees sufficient time for the robot to clear the immediate disturbance and for the external pose estimation system to provide settled, stable data.\n",
    "* Avoidance Threshold ($\\mathbf{400}$): This low $\\text{SENSOR\\_THRESHOLD}$ was selected to trigger avoidance preemptively (at a greater distance). Early reaction is preferred to aggressive, late braking, especially given the high $\\text{AVOID\\_SPEED}$ ($\\mathbf{125.0}$).\n",

    "The avoidance mechanism is a differential steering technique where the $\\text{turn}_{\\text{weight}}$ is derived from the weighted sensor inputs.\n",

    "\n",
    "If the inner sensors ($\\text{sensor}[1]$ and $\\text{sensor}[3]$) are roughly equal ($\\text{symmetric threat}$), the controller forces a dramatic increase in the weight of the outer sensors ($W_{\\text{outer}} \\to 2.3$, $W_{\\text{inner}} \\to 0$), compelling the robot to commit quickly to the side with the slightest opening. Otherwise, standard weights ($\\mathbf{1.7}$ inner, $\\mathbf{1.0}$ outer) are used for finer correctional steering.\n",

    "| $\\text{Rotation Gain}$ | $\\mathbf{0.025}$ | A low gain applied to the $\\text{turn}_{\\text{weight}}$.

    "* **Turning Weight Calculation (Dynamic):** The $\\text{turn}_{\\text{weight}}$ is calculated using a **dynamic sensor weighting** strategy to adapt to different obstacle geometries. Base weights ($\\mathbf{1.7}$ inner, $\\mathbf{1.0}$ outer) are used for general threats. However, if the threat is frontal/symmetric ($\\text{sensor}[1] \\approx \\text{sensor}[3]$), inner sensors are ignored ($\\mathbf{0.0}$) and outer sensors are heavily prioritized ($\\mathbf{2.3}$) to force a sharp directional evasion.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The weighted difference is computed as:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\text{turn}_{\\text{weight}} = (S_0 \\cdot W_{\\text{outer}} + S_1 \\cdot W_{\\text{inner}}) - (S_3 \\cdot W_{\\text{inner}} + S_4 \\cdot W_{\\text{outer}})\n",

    "\n",
    "    This ensures the robot gradually shifts from prioritizing simple forward stability (when $\\text{decay} \\approx 1.0$) back to complex goal-seeking control (when $\\text{decay} \\approx 0.0$).\n",
