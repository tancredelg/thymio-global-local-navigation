    "# Basics of Mobile Robotics, Project report \n",
    "\n",
    "The final project for EPFL's [**MICRO-452: Basics of Mobile Robotics**](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/basics-of-mobile-robotics-MICRO-452) course. This project implements a complete navigation stack for a differential drive robot, featuring computer vision, graph-based path planning, sensor fusion (EKF), and reactive control.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Concept:** Inspired by the Disney movie WALL·E, the robot EVE must navigate through the interior of the spaceship Axiom - a complex and hazardous environment. Her mission is to reach, her love,  WALL·E as fast as possible, while avoiding a series of dangerous obstacles.\n",
    "The map includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Windows: Represented as static dark-blue polygonal regions that EVE must not cross. These areas act as boundaries or fatal zones, similar to voids in the spacecraft’s structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Humans (“Passengers”): Large, drifting individuals who move unpredictably through the corridors. They function as dynamic obstacles that EVE must detect and avoid in real time.\n",

    "## 1. Physical Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The project tasks a Thymio II robot with navigating from a start pose to a goal pose while avoiding two distinct types of obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 The Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The playground consist of a white rectangle of 130x92 cm delimitated by four Aruco Marker place on each of the 4 corners.\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment presents a dual-layer challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Static \"Global\" Obstacles (The Windows):**\n",
    "    -   **Physicality:** Flat, dark blue polygonal cutouts.\n",
    "    -   **Visibility:** _Invisible_ to the robot's onboard horizontal proximity sensors, but clearly visible to the overhead global camera.\n",
    "    -   **Constraint:** The robot cannot drive over them. Avoiding them relies entirely on accurate global localization and path planning.\n",
    "2.  **Ephemeral \"Local\" Obstacles (The Passengers):**\n",
    "    -   **Physicality:** 3D physical objects (cylinders, blocks) roughly the size of the robot.\n",
    "    -   **Visibility:** Visible to the robot's onboard sensors, but _ignored_ by the global camera mapping (or placed after mapping is complete).\n",
    "    -   **Constraint:** These act as dynamic blockers. The robot must use local sensing to reactively avoid them without losing track of its global objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 The Robot\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Thymio II** is a differential-drive mobile robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Sensors:** 5 front-facing and 2 rear-facing horizontal IR proximity sensors (for local avoidance).\n",
    "-   **Comms:** Python API interfacing via USB/RF dongle.\n",
    "-   **Markers:** An ArUco marker is mounted on top of the robot to facilitate high-precision global tracking (Pose: $x, y, \\theta$) via the overhead camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 The Camera\n",
    "\n",
    "We're usging our smartphone mounted overhead to have a better quality and beging less sentistive to the environment. With the software \"Camo studio\" we are able the read the phone camera at $1920 \\times 1080$, RGB, 30 FPS and transmit to the program.\n",

    "## 2. Vision System\n",
    "The vision systeme serves as the \"GPS\" of the system, responsible for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initial Mapping:** Detecting static obstacle polygons and the goal area.\n",
    "2.  **Live Tracking:** Providing absolute position estimates to correct the robot's drifting odometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 System Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The vision pipeline operates in two distinct phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.1 Initialization Phase (Static Mapping)\n",
    "During startup, the system captures a single reference frame and extracts the complete static environment:\n",
    "- Calibration markers define the workspace boundaries\n",
    "- Static obstacles (the \"spacecraft windows\") are segmented and converted to polygonal representations\n",
    "- Goal location (WALL·E's position) is identified\n",
    "- Visibility graph is pre-computed for path planning\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.2 Runtime Phase (Real-Time Localization)\n",
    "During navigation, the system continuously:\n",
    "- Captures frames at approximately 10 Hz\n",
    "- Detects (EVE's position) the robot's ArUco marker\n",
    "- Computes the robot's pose $(x, y, \\theta)$\n",
    "- Provides measurements to the Extended Kalman Filter for sensor fusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Coordinate Systems and Perspective Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "The vision system must bridge two distinct coordinate frames:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Camera Frame:** The raw image captured by the overhead camera, measured in pixels with origin at top-left, where coordinates are $(u, v) \\in [0, 1920] \\times [0, 1080]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**World Frame:** The robot's navigation space, measured in centimeters with origin at bottom-left of the workspace, where coordinates are $(x, y) \\in [0,132.5 ] \\times [0, 92.5]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.1 Perspective Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the camera's mounting angle and lens distortion, the raw image exhibits perspective distortion. We use a **homography transformation** to warp the image into an orthographic (bird's-eye) view:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} u' \\\\ v' \\\\ w \\end{bmatrix} = \\mathbf{H} \\begin{bmatrix} u \\\\ v \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{H} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 3}$ is the perspective transformation matrix computed via OpenCV's `getPerspectiveTransform()` using the four corner calibration markers as control points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final pixel coordinates after perspective correction are:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_{\\text{px}} = \\frac{u'}{w}, \\quad y_{\\text{px}} = \\frac{v'}{w}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.2 Metric Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "After warping, we convert from the rectified pixel space to world coordinates (cm):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_{\\text{cm}} = \\frac{x_{\\text{px}}}{\\alpha_x}, \\quad y_{\\text{cm}} = H_{\\text{map}} - \\frac{y_{\\text{px}}}{\\alpha_y}\n",

    "#### 2.3.2 Morphological Filtering\n",
    "To eliminate noise and fill gaps in the segmented regions, we apply morphological operations with a $7 \\times 7$ kernel:\n",

We leverage two Python libraries for this task: **Shapely** for geometric operations (polygon intersection, line-polygon collision detection) and **NetworkX** for graph representation and manipulation.\n",

    "This prevents spurious intersections when paths graze obstacle corners.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.6.4 Boundary Cropping\n",
    "After constructing the full graph, we perform a final validation step: **remove any nodes that lie outside the map boundaries**. Due to the buffering operation, some obstacle vertices may extend beyond the physical workspace limits $[0, W_{\\text{map}}] \\times [0, H_{\\text{map}}]$.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2.6.5 Base Graph Storage\n",
    "The result of this process is the **base visibility graph**, which contains only obstacle vertices and the goal node. This graph is computed once during initialization and stored as `self.base_graph`. The robot's start position is intentionally excluded at this stage to enable dynamic replanning after kidnapping events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.7 Dynamic Graph Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the robot's start position changes after each kidnapping event, the visibility graph must be **dynamically updated**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Graph:** Contains only obstacle vertices and the goal (precomputed once)\n",
    "2. **Runtime Augmentation:** When the robot is relocated:\n",
    "   - Add a new start node $v_{\\text{start}}$ at the robot's current pose\n",
    "   - Test visibility from $v_{\\text{start}}$ to all existing nodes\n",
    "   - Connect $v_{\\text{start}}$ to all visible nodes with weighted edges\n",
    "   - Run A* search on the augmented graph\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy avoids recomputing the entire $O(n^3)$ visibility graph (where $n \\approx 40$ nodes) after every kidnapping - we only perform $O(n^2)$ visibility tests from the new start node.\n",
